# Democratic School
## Idea
Democratic School is a side project. The main goal is to provide a platform where students from my school can publish ideas to our representatives. With those ideas, my school may become a better place to learn.
## Technology
This project uses React as its client JS library and Quarkus (with keycloak) for storing and sharing data.
